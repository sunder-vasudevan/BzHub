# BzHub Prompt Library (Consolidated)

This library groups reusable prompts by intent (not by chat sequence). Each item is formatted for quick reuse in the BzHub codebase.

## UI & UX

**Overall UI & Theme**
- “Full UI overhaul. Modern/tech‑forward. Use purple as the main color. Add a dark mode toggle. Don’t make design decisions—ask one question at a time. I want top navigation with some main options on the side.”
- “Use open‑source icons but don’t include icon files. Use placeholders.”

**Dashboard & Reports**
- “Dashboard first. Sales and inventory equally important. Add projections for 7/30/quarter/year. I want charts and trends.”
- “Reports should show charts and summary cards.”
- “Charts should resize across screen sizes with axes and labels scaling too.”
- “Double‑click a chart to open a larger view; single‑click to close.”

**Login & Branding**
- “Add an image/logo on the login screen. Create a logo where B and H share something visually.”
- “Increase login window size, bind Enter/Return to login, and remove duplicate branding on the login screen.”

**Section Styling**
- “HR should be card‑based employee profiles with consistent styling.”
- “Bills history should be timeline‑style.”
- “Visitors should be displayed as cards.”

**Settings**
- “Company info should be restricted with an admin unlock button.”

## CRM, POS, Inventory, and Sales

**Navigation**
- “Move Inventory, POS, Reports, Bills, and Visitors under a CRM tab.”

**POS**
- “POS should have a numpad, quick add buttons, and search for inventory items.”
- “Remove the numeric buttons in add‑to‑cart.”
- “POS should print the latest receipt.”
- “Show a print preview first for bills and POS receipts.”

**Inventory**
- “Add an image field to inventory items with browse and saved image path.”

**Bills**
- “Bills should print any selected sale/bill.”

## HR, Payroll, and Appraisals

**Employees**
- “Add an employee details dialog to create employees.”
- “Add activate/deactivate employees and show status.”
- “Add employee ID card printing with preview.”

**Payroll**
- “Add a payroll system with service, DB, and UI.”
- “Move payroll under HR as a sub‑tab.”

**Appraisals**
- “Add an appraisals workflow: Self‑appraisal → 360 feedback → Manager review → Final rating. 360 requests can be created by both manager and employee. Anyone can give feedback anytime.”

## Data, Analytics, and Seeding

**Analytics**
- “Add an analytics layer with queries for trends and projections to support dashboard charts.”

**Seeding**

## Customization & Safety

**Quick Actions**

## App Identity

**Rename App**
- “Rename the app to BzHub everywhere.”

## Documentation & Cleanup

**Docs**

## Planning & Roadmap

**Next‑Feature Planning**

## Notes
- These prompts assume the BzHub architecture and file structure already exist.
- Add constraints (deadlines, target files, design rules) for faster execution.
